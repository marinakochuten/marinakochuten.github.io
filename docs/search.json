As an emerging data scientist, I am constantly curious, creative, and eager to apply my newly developed skills to ecology and conservation. Outside of my work, you can find me cooking a fresh vegetarian meal, enjoying all things outdoors, and hanging with my pup Tahoma. Poke around my site to learn more about me and my work!\n\n\nEducation\nMaster of Environmental Data Science (Expected June 2024)\n\nBren School of Environmental Science & Management | University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)\n\nBachelor of Science in Environmental Science & Resource Management (December 2019)\n\nUniversity of Washington (UW), Seattle, WA\nStudy Abroad: Council on International Educational Exchange, Tropical Ecology & Conservation, Costa Rica (January – May 2019)"
