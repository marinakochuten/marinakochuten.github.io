Hi! I’m Marina. Currently, I am a Masters student in Environmental Data Science at UCSB’s Bren School of Environmental Science & Resource Management. I am constantly curious, creative, and eager to apply my new data science skills to ecology and conservation. Outside of my work, you can find me cooking a fresh vegetarian meal, enjoying all things outdoors, and adventuring in my self-built campervan. Poke around my site to learn more about me and my work!
