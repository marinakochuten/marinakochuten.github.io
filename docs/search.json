I am constantly curious, creative, and eager to apply my new data science skills to ecology and conservation. Outside of my work, you can find me cooking a fresh vegetarian meal, enjoying all things outdoors, and adventuring in my self-built campervan. Poke around my site to learn more about me and my work!"
