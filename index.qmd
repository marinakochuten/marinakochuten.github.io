### hi!

**I’m Marina.** I am a constantly curious and creative **data scientist**, motivated to apply my interdisciplinary skills to advancing equitable, real-world solutions. Passionate about conservation, ecology, Indigenous sovereignty and TEK, justice-centered policy solutions, and structural inequities produced by systems of power and exclusion - and equipped with strong research, coding, and communication skills - I bring a thoughtful, community-centered lens to data analysis and storytelling.

Outside of my work, you can find me cooking a fresh vegetarian meal, enjoying all things outdoors, and hanging with my pup Tahoma. Poke around my site to learn more about me and my work!
