## the lore

**My approach to data science is grounded in people, place, and ecology.** I am mixed-Indigenous Unangax̂ raised on Coast Salish lands in Northwestern Washington State, a community at the forefront of climate change adaptation and community-led environmental stewardship. These landscapes, and the people connected to them, shaped how I think about systems, responsibility, and the role data can play in supporting informed decision-making.

I hold a **BS in Environmental Science and Resource Management** from the University of Washington (2019) and a **Master of Environmental Data Science** from the University of California, Santa Barbara (2025). Together, these experiences shaped my interdisciplinary approach: combining quantitative analysis, programming, and clear, thoughtful communication to solve complex problems.

By nature, **I am an enthusiastic puzzle solver.** I thrive in collaborative environments, surrounded by diverse thinkers and actors. I strive to foster inclusive spaces, drive meaningful change, and ensure that data serves people and communities.

## the work

My early training in ecology informs how I approach data today. As an undergraduate, I contributed to research on methane emissions from permafrost thaw bogs and completed a capstone project in Costa Rica’s cloud forest examining relationships between mycorrhizal abundance and soil organic carbon. After graduating, I worked as a field ecologist with the National Park Service through UW Botanic Gardens’ RareCare program, applying GIS and developing long-term monitoring methods to support conservation of rare alpine plants in Olympic and North Cascades National Parks.

I am now a Data Analyst at Puget Sound Restoration Fund, a nonprofit practicing science-based restoration for people and place in the Salish Sea. I serve as the Habitat Program's sole data specialist, providing core support in data analysis & writing for [Olympia Oyster Restoration](https://restorationfund.org/programs/olympiaoysters/) & [Bull Kelp Recovery](https://restorationfund.org/programs/bullkelp/).

Across my work, I am particularly interested in data visualization, interdisciplinary collaboration, and clear communication, using data not just to analyze systems, but to tell stories that support equitable, evidence-based decisions.

Take a look at [my work](posts.qmd) to see some past projects.

## the play

When my head is not buried in code, you can find me pursuing my many other interests:

I love taking inspiration from my surroundings for bead project color palettes! These became Tse'Bii'Ndzisgaii (Monument Valley, UT) inspired earrings

-   **Indoors:** Bead weaving, cooking for friends, trying out a new craft, or diving into my ever-growing stack of to-be-read books.

-   **Outdoors:** Biking, hiking, bouldering, swimming in natural bodies of water, and nerding out over nature.

-   **On the road:** Traveling in my self-built campervan, *Trashcan the Van*, alongside my beautiful dog Tahoma. Always happy to chat DIY solar systems, woodworking, or road-trip planning `r fontawesome::fa("smile", fill = "#444444", a11y = "sem")`
