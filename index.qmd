### Hi!

**I’m Marina.** Currently, I am a Masters student in Environmental Data Science at UCSB’s Bren School of Environmental Science & Resource Management. As an emerging data scientist, I am constantly curious, creative, and eager to apply my newly developed skills to ecology and conservation. Outside of my work, you can find me cooking a fresh vegetarian meal, enjoying all things outdoors, and hanging with my pup Tahoma. Poke around my site to learn more about me and my work!
