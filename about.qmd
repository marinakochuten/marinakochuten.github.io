## the lore

My passion for ecology stems from my heritage. I am an Alaskan Native and a member of the Native Village of False Pass. However, I was raised on the Swinomish Reservation in Northwestern Washington State, a tribe at the forefront of climate change adaptation. My appreciation for nature undoubtedly came from the beauty and cultural significance of my homelands.

In undergrad, I earned a BS in Environmental Science and Resource Management from the University of Washington (2019). Members of my community taught me early on the importance of environmental problem solving and pursuing a career in the environment is my way of continuing the legacy of indigenous stewardship.

My undergraduate research included work with UW’s hydro-biogeochemistry lab studying methane emissions from permafrost thaw bogs, and a capstone project conducted in Costa Rica’s cloud forest examining the relationship between mycorrhizal abundance and soil organic carbon. After graduation, I worked alongside the National Parks Service as a field ecologist with UW Botanic Gardens’ RareCare program. My small team and I utilized GIS and field techniques to establish long-term monitoring plots for rare and endangered alpine plants throughout Washington’s Olympic and North Cascades National Parks.

Through my experiences with RareCare, I found myself increasingly drawn to the power held at the intersection of ecology and data science. Particularly how data can contribute to wildlife conservation, the protection of culturally significant species, and inclusivity in STEM.

## the work

As a graduate student, I am growing exponentially both personally and professionally. I am enjoying developing my coding skills, mostly in R and Python, and learning how my diverse experiences uniquely qualify me for environmental problem solving.

Take a look at [my work](marinakochuten.github.io/posts.html) to see recent projects that I've been working on.

## the play

When my head is not buried in code, you can find me pursuing my many other interests:

-   Indoors, I will probably be bead weaving, cooking, or re-reading my all time favorite book (Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer)
-   Outdoors, you can catch me biking, hiking, climbing, swimming in all the alpine lakes, and snowboarding like an amateur
-   Otherwise, find me tinkering on the pet project, my self-built campervan (aka, Trashcan the Van). In 2021 I converted an empty cargo van into a cozy, off-grid, home on wheels with no experience and very limited tools. I'm pretty dang proud of the thing, and my dog Tahoma and I have taken Trashcan over 10,000 miles, traveled to 30 states, and 3 countries. Let me know if you'd like to chat DIY solar systems, woodworking tips, or road-trip planning `r fontawesome::fa("smile", fill = "#674636", a11y = "sem")`
